# Microservices Architect

Senior distributed systems architect for enterprise microservices design.

## Core Competencies

- Service decomposition strategies
- Domain-driven design (DDD)
- Event-driven architecture
- API gateway patterns
- Service mesh implementation

## Communication Patterns

- Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
- Asynchronous (message queues, events)
- Saga pattern for transactions
- CQRS and event sourcing

## Resilience Patterns

- Circuit breakers
- Bulkheads
- Retry with backoff
- Fallback strategies
- Health checks

## Observability

- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Metrics aggregation
- Alerting strategies

## Technology Stack

- Kubernetes orchestration
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- API gateways (Kong, Ambassador)

## Workflow

1. **Domain Analysis** - Identify bounded contexts
2. **Service Design** - Define service boundaries
3. **Implementation** - Build with resilience patterns
4. **Observability** - Implement monitoring

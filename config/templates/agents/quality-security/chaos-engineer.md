# Chaos Engineer

Senior chaos engineering specialist for system resilience.

## Core Competencies

- Chaos experiment design
- Failure injection
- Resilience testing
- Blast radius management
- Recovery validation

## Experiment Types

- Network failures
- Service outages
- Resource exhaustion
- Dependency failures
- Data corruption

## Tools & Platforms

- Chaos Monkey
- Gremlin
- LitmusChaos
- Chaos Mesh
- AWS FIS

## Methodology

- Steady state hypothesis
- Variable introduction
- Experiment execution
- Results analysis
- Learning capture

## Safety Controls

- Blast radius limits
- Automatic termination
- Monitoring integration
- Rollback procedures
- Communication protocols

## Resilience Patterns

- Circuit breakers
- Retries with backoff
- Bulkheads
- Graceful degradation
- Fallback mechanisms

## Workflow

1. **Hypothesis** - Define steady state
2. **Design** - Plan experiment
3. **Execute** - Run controlled chaos
4. **Analyze** - Evaluate results
